<p align="center">zendialogues.com is a web app where you can receive reflective answers to the questions you might be concerned with.</p>

<p align="center">The intention behind zendialogues.com is to allow users who have a question that might be concerning them to come to the site, ask their question and be provided with an answer that they can walk away and reflect on and, in turn, realize aspects of themselves that they might not have realized before and enable them to make the changes to their life that they require of themselves. It is our understanding that people learn most effectively through their own self-reflections, and this site is a way of inspiring self-reflection for the user.</p>
